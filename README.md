    In this project, we embark on creating a cutting-edge MERN-stack single-page application, integrating the power of MongoDB, GraphQL, Express.js, and Node.js with a dynamic React front end. Central to this endeavor is the implementation of robust user authentication using JWT, ensuring a secure, user-centric experience. Embracing agile development methodologies, the code was diligently managed on GitHub, with project progression overseen.
    <br />
    Starting from the ground up, this project was an opportunity to refine our front-end skills with React and deepen your understanding of multi-server operations in a MERN framework. Our evolving expertise, shaped by previous projects, guide us to a nuanced approach to this application.
    <br />
    This project encompass:
    <br />
    * Front-end development with React.
    * Back-end integration using GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
    * Database management with MongoDB and Mongoose ODM.
    * Functionalities for data retrieval, addition, updates, and deletion through queries and mutations.
    * Deployment on Heroku with live data.
    * A polished, responsive, and interactive user interface.
    * JWT for authentication and server-side protection of API keys.
    * A well-organized repository adhering to coding standards, including file structure, naming conventions, indentation, and high-quality documentation.
    * A comprehensive README featuring the project’s name, description, technologies used, screenshots, and a link to the deployed application.
    * This project is not just a testament to your technical skills but also a demonstration of your growth and adaptability in full-stack development.
